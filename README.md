# Code Refactor Challenge

## Project Description

This project involves the absolute basics of HTML and CSS by refactoring the starter code assigned to us by the professors during our first week in the bootcamp. The main issues worked on for the project were the inaccessibility for people with disabilities that use assistive technologies for the site, and were fixed by switching HTML tags from '<div>' to '<nav>', as well as adding the "alt" to the images such that it described the picture in the website for the customer.

The use of ids and classes for the website's navigation purposes as well as the visual appealingness of the site were also a great and rewarded challenge faced in this first project.
